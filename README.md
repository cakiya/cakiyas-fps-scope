# cakiyas-fps-scope
fps scope ahk script (no screen recorder included)
very useful in tatctical shooters where you have to be 3 inches from your screen (this is so people cna play on 14 inch gaming laptop without breaking their eyes)

# How does this work?
1. you get a recording software of some kind with a preview (i use OBS, right click preiew and click windowed preview)
2. run script type in the window title
3. press "`" to see it in action (it will overlay the window but not focus it when held down and hide it when released)

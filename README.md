# cakiyas-fps-scope
This is an AHK (AutoHotkey) script that allows you to specify a window to use as the "scope" (ideally a window of a preview of a recording of the game), and a hotkey ` to use as a toggle.

Basically it's like a sniper scope in games, hold down the hotkey to overlay the preview, and release to hide the preview.

# How to use?
1. get a recording software of some kind with a preview (like OBS, right click preiew then click Windowed Projector (Preview))
2. run script, select your window (if OBS, select Windowed Projector (Preview))
3. press " ` " to see it in action

# To-Do
1. add shortcuts guide, with checkbox
2. make a demo vid that's more concise and actually shows the centering feature and quitting
3. maybe also add a sens shift down when scoped? cause zoomed in is a bit hard to control (you can do thisi manually with mouse macros that press the scope hotkey and change dpi at the same time but that only works for gaming mice and it's not a feature of this application really)

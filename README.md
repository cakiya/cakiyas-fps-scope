Fps games scope ahk script (no screen recorder included)

This is an AutoHotkey script that allows you to specify a window to use as the "scope" (ideally a window of a preview of a recording of the game), and a hotkey ` to use as a toggle.

Basically it's like a sniper scope in games, hold down the hotkey to overlay the preview, and release to hide the preview.

very useful in tatctical shooters where you have to be 3 inches from your screen (this is so people cna play on 14 inch gaming laptop without breaking their eyes)

# How to use?
1. you get a recording software of some kind with a preview (i use OBS, right click preiew and click windowed preview)
2. run script type in the window title
3. press "`" to see it in action (it will overlay the window but not focus it when held down and hide it when released)

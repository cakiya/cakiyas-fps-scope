# cakiyas-fps-scope
This is an AutoHotkey script that allows you to specify a window to use as the "scope" (ideally a window of a preview of a recording of the game), and a hotkey ` to use as a toggle.

Basically it's like a sniper scope in games, hold down the hotkey to overlay the preview, and release to hide the preview.

# How to use?
1. you get a recording software of some kind with a preview (like OBS, right click preiew then click Windowed Projector (Preview))
2. run script, select your window (if OBS, select Windowed Projector (Preview))
3. press " ` " to see it in action

Current Hotkeys:
